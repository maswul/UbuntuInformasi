Step 1: Prerequisites

Our first task is to define our goal and scope.

Ubuntu machine name = ubsrv
Machine IP address = 192.168.71.131
Shares = Samba
Share2 = /Samba/Allaccess
Share3 = /Samba/Allaccess/Secure
Workgroup = WORKGROUP

Step 2: Configure Windows host file with Ubuntu host IP

If DNS is involved then you can skip this. However, if you’re running this from your lab environment without DNS, then you’ll want to add Ubuntu machine hostname and IP address to Windows host file.

On Windows computer, open the command prompt as administrator and run the commands below.

notepad C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

Then add the line below at the end of the file.

192.168.71.131                              ubsrv

Also, make sure the Windows computer is a member of WORKGROUP. By default, it is.
Step 3: Install Samba Packages

The next step is to install Samba packages on the Ubuntu system. To do that, run the commands below.

sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y samba samba-common python-glade2 system-config-samba

Step 4: Configure Samba Global options

Now that Samba is installed, go and configure and define Samba global options. First thing is to backup the original Samba configuration file. To do that, run the commands below.

sudo mv /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.bak

Then run the commands below to create a new Samba config file.

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

In the new file, create a global configuration block, configure it like what shown below and save the file.

[global]
workgroup = WORKGROUP
server string = Samba Server %v
netbios name = ubsrv
security = user
map to guest = bad user
name resolve order = bcast host
dns proxy = no

Step 5: Create Samba Folders

Next, go and create the samba shares. The one command line below create all three folders.

sudo mkdir -p /Samba/Allaccess/Secure

Next, grant everyone access to the Allaccess folder. To grant everyone access to the folder, run the commands below.

cd /Samba
sudo chmod -R 0755 Allaccess/
sudo chown -R nobody:nogroup Allaccess/

Step 6: Share the folder via samba

Now that you’ve created the folders and have given access to everyone, go back to Samba configuration file and enable sharing on that folder.

Open Samba config file again and paste the above below the [global] block.

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Then copy and paste the block below into the file and save.

[Allaccess]
path = /Samba/Allaccess
browsable = yes
writable = yes
guest ok = yes
read only = no

At this point, the smb.conf file should look like this:

[global]
workgroup = WORKGROUP
server string = Samba Server %v
netbios name = srvr1
security = user
map to guest = bad user
name resolve order = bcast host
dns proxy = no
#================= Share Definitions ==========================
[AllAccess]
path = /Samba/Allaccess
browsable =yes
writable = yes
guest ok = yes
read only = no

Restart Samba and test the first share.

sudo service smbd restart

When you browse with Windows File Explorer, you’ll see the first share.
ubuntu samba file share

Next, go and secure the Secure folder so that only member of a group will be able to access it.

First create a secure group on Ubuntu by running the commands below:

sudo addgroup securedgroup

Then secure the Secure folder by making richard the owner and give securedgroup members access

cd /Samba/Allaccess
sudo chown -R richard:securedgroup Secure/
sudo chmod -R 0770 Secure/

With the settings above, only the account named richard and members of of securedgroup will access the Secure folder inside /Samba/Allaccess

Next, go to the Samba config file again and create the Secure share. Copy and paste the block in the file below the other blocks.

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

Copy and paste the block code below into the file and save.

[Secure]
path = /Samba/Allaccess/Secure
valid users = @securedgroup
guest ok = no
writable = yes
browsable = yes

Save the file, restart Samba and you’re done. If an account isn’t a member of the securedgroup, access will be denied.
ubuntu samba access rights

To add an account to the secure group, run the commands below.

sudo usermod -a -G securedgroup richard

Then add the account to Samba database for access. You’ll be prompted to create a new password for Samba. Do it. You must always add the user account to Samba database before access is granted. Do it by running the commands below.

sudo smbpasswd -a richard

Restart Samba and try again with the user account richard again. This time access will be granted. If Windows prompts, type the account name and password to access the shared folder.

That’s it! Hope this helps!
